Problem Statement :
There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.

Given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

Now, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.



Example 1:

Input: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2
Output: 2
